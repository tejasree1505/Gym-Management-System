# Gym-Management-System
The Gym Management System is a console-based C programming project designed for efficient handling of gym member data. 
It enables operations such as member addition, removal, search, and record editing. 
The system calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizes health status. 
Data is stored in a binary file (`gymdata.txt`) for data persistence. 
The program utilizes linked lists for member data organization and provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface. 
The project is compiled using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and demonstrates file handling, data structures, and user input validation.
